    </h1>

    <div class="postbody e-content"><p>You're visiting <a href="http://topposts.net">topposts.net</a>, the website created by Cohost user @topghost after it was announced that Cohost would be shut down.</p>
<p>It's a single-user blog for something similar to what some people refer to as "shitposting", which I see as just... trying to have a good time online.<br>
It's built to be durable, fast, and simple. It uses the Eleventy framework to generate static content, which will hopefully always give you the actual "content" of the blog without requiring any additional local runtime. If you do have a browser with JavaScript, it should have some nice enhancements that make the page nicer-- but also a lot of those enhancements are actually there to make it so that when <em>I</em> visit, I have easy ways to interact with that static content and publish a new copy afterwards, so I can write posts, edit and delete them, and change some metadata on the site's overall structure to adapt to what I want to do at any given point in time.</p>
<p>I'm calling the thing I'm writing to make that possible "Octobug", "bug" as a reference to Cohost, whose ergonomics inspired me to layout the blog that you actually see in this opinionated way, and "Octo" as a nod to the fact that I'm building the mechanism by which publishing and posting happens around GitHub's REST API, git repos, and GitHub Pages product. It's free, short of the domain name that carves it out as a space on the internet. The software is <em>not</em> prepared to be shared with just anyone right now but I am hoping to find the time to backport most of the customizations I've made to my blog to the repo I set up as a starting point, and to document what you need to do to set that up yourself. If you're interested and willing to work with me to document all of that, let me know and maybe we can walk through it together.</p>
<p>Okay this page is the only one where I'm guaranteed to be earnest. Go read the posts.</p>
