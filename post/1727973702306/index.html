I for one have been using RSS pretty much daily since the early 00s.</p>

<p>I would say I fall off of daily RSS reading and then hop back on something like 3-4 times a year and have been since Google Reader died in 2013. It didn’t help that most of the people I knew personally stopped blogging (tho I’m also LARGELY guilty of that— I have been in the 3-to-4 posts a year camp on my primary self-hosted blog) and so my RSS feeds are mostly journalism, news, some weird accumulated tumblr pages, the random people I follow but don’t know who HAVE been blogging faithfully all this time, and (as the newsletter rebirth exploded and Feedbin added support for them) all the email newsletters I’m over-subscribed to.</p>
<p>So I’ve been a paid user of Feedbin since something like 2015? I love it, but I also like to do a lot of things in my life and am definitely overcommitted to work and hobbies and family/housekeeping. Things fall by the wayside and as Cohost became a decent way for me to feel “aware” of what was happening online I fell back into one of my periods of less RSS reading.</p>
<p>As Cohost was wrapping up I subscribed to almost every feed I saw people linking to, putting them in a new folder in Feedbin for just them. When I added the feed I put their Cohost username at the end in parentheses, but last night I realized that I wanted to flip it— I put <code>@username</code> at the front and then put all their carefully considered blog titles in parentheses after that. That small change makes me feel a little bit closer to everyone, as silly as it sounds. (I don’t consider this blog to have a “title” per se, btw— I think topposts dot net is fine for now)</p>
<p>PS I’m hoping by the end of the weekend I’ll have working h-entry post embeds like Natalie does!! It’s so cool to see it working at the link at the top of the post and if you haven’t checked out <a href="https://nex-3.com/">her blog</a> overall you really should!</p>
