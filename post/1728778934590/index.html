    <div class="postbody e-content"><p>inspired by <a href="https://entangled.one/post/1728774235-image-uploads-not-the/">li's roadmap</a> I guess I will share an updated and mostly-off-the-cuff version of mine, based on a quick scan of my original goals and the mountain of todo list items I have accumulated since then:</p>
<ul>
<li>I gotta get h-entry consumption working so I can "reblog" everyone else who's publishing with it (and bully the rest of you into adding support so I can reblog you too)</li>
<li>The post editor has some rough styling edges that I would like to sand down a bit. I want the headline and body fields to grow with the post. The buttons are ass and I would like them to not be ass</li>
<li>I need to write some static pages for a blogroll and possibly some other stuff? This isn't actually programming or anything, I have no excuse for not doing this sooner</li>
<li>I want a "pinned tags" widget that makes sense on the page in both desktop and mobile</li>
<li>posts should be editable without using the git repo</li>
<li>posts should be draftable (I agree with li, localstorage is probably fine for now, though it would be nice to have some alternate strategy</li>
<li>I need to pull out a bunch of blog-specific things that have been hardcoded and put them into Eleventy Data Files so that my blog is more easily customizable and also probably so I can just take this code, .gitignore the Content and Data files, and force-push back into the octobug repo to have a clean working Eleventy base template.</li>
<li>I admit I have not been making any progress on also making it possible to use Octobug with an existing static site setup / your own metadata structure. It's going to be kinda hard and finicky and weird and I'm not looking forward to it, sorry!!!!</li>
<li>I have a couple other very stupid but pretty funny ideas that I'm going to keep a secret for now ðŸ¤«</li>
</ul>
<p>it's fun that me and a few other people have spent the last ~month tricking each other into using our accumulated programming skills to improve our lives. I mean that genuinely. Ok I really gotta take a shower now bye</p>
