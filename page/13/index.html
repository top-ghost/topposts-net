    <div class="postbody e-content"><p>I think the most insulting thing about “motion smoothing” on TVs is that it doesn’t even work right on a lot of them! There’s a screen tearing effect every 5-6 seconds during scenes where the camera is moving quickly because it can’t actually keep up? Like if you’re going to make everything look like ass at least take it seriously</p>

        <a href="https://topposts.net/post/1734081191900/">Patch 13.2.1: Flurbo is here?!</a>
    </h1>

    <div class="postbody e-content"><p>Jolly Jinglefest to everyone out there who's still enjoying Orb Minders: Weavecast in its FOURTH YEAR! With the year winding down, but the Jinglefest season heating up, we've got one more announcement for the community this year that we think might just make your holidays a little more merry.</p>
<p>Patch 13.2.1 on Tuesday of COURSE features the bugfix that will allow us to FINALLY restore Rince the Skin-Flayer to the Mercenaries pool (when the Witching Hour remains unbanned by your warband, of course). We appreciate your patience while ol' Rinny has had to sit on the bench due to that exploit we all caught thanks to SneakyPete's viral Twitch clip. But if the whole idea of a bugfix release is putting you to sleep... don't check out just yet, because there may be a special little guy who's tagging along for the ride!</p>
<p>Flurbo is purely cosmetic, adorably cuddly, and is ready to be your best pal.</p>
<p>Flurbo grants NO ADVANTAGE in-game, is a purely optional purchase, and after you dismiss one shop notification about "new items", we won't ever nag you about its availability again.</p>
<p>Flurbo was hand-animated by longtime community member Kendall Price, who's never done professional work in the industry before this moment. This addition to their resume represents the start of us paying back everything they've contributed up until this point purely for the love of the community. Thanks Kendall!</p>
<p>Flurbo is your friend. Its design was done under the supervision of a record seventeen sensitivity consultants.</p>
<p>Nothing can possibly go wrong with Flurbo's launch, and we won't allow you to ruin this for us.</p>
