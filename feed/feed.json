With the year winding down, but the Jinglefest season heating up, we've got one more announcement for the community this year that we think might just make your holidays a little more merry.</p>\n<p>Patch 13.2.1 on Tuesday of COURSE features the bugfix that will allow us to FINALLY restore Rince the Skin-Flayer to the Mercenaries pool (when the Witching Hour remains unbanned by your warband, of course). We appreciate your patience while ol' Rinny has had to sit on the bench due to that exploit we all caught thanks to SneakyPete's viral Twitch clip. But if the whole idea of a bugfix release is putting you to sleep... don't check out just yet, because there may be a special little guy who's tagging along for the ride!</p>\n<p>Flurbo is purely cosmetic, adorably cuddly, and is ready to be your best pal.</p>\n<p>Flurbo grants NO ADVANTAGE in-game, is a purely optional purchase, and after you dismiss one shop notification about \"new items\", we won't ever nag you about its availability again.</p>\n<p>Flurbo was hand-animated by longtime community member Kendall Price, who's never done professional work in the industry before this moment. This addition to their resume represents the start of us paying back everything they've contributed up until this point purely for the love of the community. Thanks Kendall!</p>\n<p>Flurbo is your friend. Its design was done under the supervision of a record seventeen sensitivity consultants.</p>\n<p>Nothing can possibly go wrong with Flurbo's launch, and we won't allow you to ruin this for us.</p>\n<p>Flurbo approaches.

			"content_html": "<p>via <a href=\"https://nex-3.com/blog/ive-been-surprised-how/\">natalie</a>, in reply to me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've been surprised how many people I've seen posting about how they're using RSS again. I guess even when talking about \"the heyday of RSS\" I was assuming that it was mostly more people joining and not using it than people stopping that caused its decline. I for one have been using RSS pretty much daily since the early 00s.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would say I fall off of daily RSS reading and then hop back on something like 3-4 times a year and have been since Google Reader died in 2013. It didn‚Äôt help that most of the people I knew personally stopped blogging (tho I‚Äôm also LARGELY guilty of that‚Äî I have been in the 3-to-4 posts a year camp on my primary self-hosted blog) and so my RSS feeds are mostly journalism, news, some weird accumulated tumblr pages, the random people I follow but don‚Äôt know who HAVE been blogging faithfully all this time, and (as the newsletter rebirth exploded and Feedbin added support for them) all the email newsletters I‚Äôm over-subscribed to.</p>\n<p>So I‚Äôve been a paid user of Feedbin since something like 2015? I love it, but I also like to do a lot of things in my life and am definitely overcommitted to work and hobbies and family/housekeeping. Things fall by the wayside and as Cohost became a decent way for me to feel ‚Äúaware‚Äù of what was happening online I fell back into one of my periods of less RSS reading.</p>\n<p>As Cohost was wrapping up I subscribed to almost every feed I saw people linking to, putting them in a new folder in Feedbin for just them. When I added the feed I put their Cohost username at the end in parentheses, but last night I realized that I wanted to flip it‚Äî I put <code>@username</code> at the front and then put all their carefully considered blog titles in parentheses after that. That small change makes me feel a little bit closer to everyone, as silly as it sounds. (I don‚Äôt consider this blog to have a ‚Äútitle‚Äù per se, btw‚Äî I think topposts dot net is fine for now)</p>\n<p>PS I‚Äôm hoping by the end of the weekend I‚Äôll have working h-entry post embeds like Natalie does!! It‚Äôs so cool to see it working at the link at the top of the post and if you haven‚Äôt checked out <a href=\"https://nex-3.com/\">her blog</a> overall you really should!</p>\n"
