I got to level 13 the day after it was released and at that point it&#x2019;s really unfurling into something more complex. I&#x2019;m excited to play more!\n"

It sucks to feel that weight for absolutely no reason, despite the fact that what you are making is _mid_, that your knowledge is cobbled together from a bizarre bombardment of information that you&#x27;ve exposed yourself to over your career, both technical and political, that realistically no one cares and if someone does it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re already doing the same thing for themselves, or hopefully will someday.\n\nI have to write things into the box and risk them getting posted to the internet in order to test if the software I wrote is working. That&#x27;s a terrible idea. Automated tests, non-production environments, there are so many ways to make this not be a necessity. And even if not, I _can_ still go delete the file from the repo if I want.\n"
