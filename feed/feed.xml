				<p>every time I wonder why I haven't played so many cool games this year I remember that I've probably put >100 hours each into final fantasy xiv, hearthstone, balatro, and watching balatro videos on youtube. it doesn't make me feel better but it does change it from being an x-files-style mystery into just an episode of hoarders</p>

			<title>not-quite-one-month-anniversary roadmap</title>
			<link href="https://topposts.net/post/1728778934590/"/>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<div>
				<p>inspired by <a href="https://entangled.one/post/1728774235-image-uploads-not-the/">li's roadmap</a> I guess I will share an updated and mostly-off-the-cuff version of mine, based on a quick scan of my original goals and the mountain of todo list items I have accumulated since then:</p>
<ul>
<li>I gotta get h-entry consumption working so I can "reblog" everyone else who's publishing with it (and bully the rest of you into adding support so I can reblog you too)</li>
<li>The post editor has some rough styling edges that I would like to sand down a bit. I want the headline and body fields to grow with the post. The buttons are ass and I would like them to not be ass</li>
<li>I need to write some static pages for a blogroll and possibly some other stuff? This isn't actually programming or anything, I have no excuse for not doing this sooner</li>
<li>I want a "pinned tags" widget that makes sense on the page in both desktop and mobile</li>
<li>posts should be editable without using the git repo</li>
<li>posts should be draftable (I agree with li, localstorage is probably fine for now, though it would be nice to have some alternate strategy</li>
<li>I need to pull out a bunch of blog-specific things that have been hardcoded and put them into Eleventy Data Files so that my blog is more easily customizable and also probably so I can just take this code, .gitignore the Content and Data files, and force-push back into the octobug repo to have a clean working Eleventy base template.</li>
<li>I admit I have not been making any progress on also making it possible to use Octobug with an existing static site setup / your own metadata structure. It's going to be kinda hard and finicky and weird and I'm not looking forward to it, sorry!!!!</li>
<li>I have a couple other very stupid but pretty funny ideas that I'm going to keep a secret for now ü§´</li>
</ul>
<p>it's fun that me and a few other people have spent the last ~month tricking each other into using our accumulated programming skills to improve our lives. I mean that genuinely. Ok I really gotta take a shower now bye</p>

				<p>when it comes to the whole mess with WordPress and Matt Mullenweg, one theory I‚Äôd like to see examined more closely is that an evil magician perhaps used a ‚Äúdumbass curse‚Äù on him as revenge for a careless act at a coffee shop or child‚Äôs birthday party. There‚Äôs even no saying how long ago this happened, or if it‚Äôs possible that it‚Äôs happened multiple times and the effects stack</p>

				<p>I think that the true "gamer's edge" is the ability to be able to watch a piece of media that depicts gaming culture and clock at any given moment whether it's authentic or not. the way a person moves their hands while playing a certain genre of game. the fidelity/depth of sound design relative to the graphical fidelity. the precise level of narrative irony vs the game's supposed release date / mainstream appeal.</p>
<p>but then if that is so then there is also a "knitter's edge", a "philatelist's edge", a "podcast fan's edge", and so on for all communities. and the most popular person among each of those worlds must be declared the edgelord</p>

			<title>We are always using RSS again</title>

				<p>via <a href="https://nex-3.com/blog/ive-been-surprised-how/">natalie</a>, in reply to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been surprised how many people I've seen posting about how they're using RSS again. I guess even when talking about "the heyday of RSS" I was assuming that it was mostly more people joining and not using it than people stopping that caused its decline. I for one have been using RSS pretty much daily since the early 00s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would say I fall off of daily RSS reading and then hop back on something like 3-4 times a year and have been since Google Reader died in 2013. It didn‚Äôt help that most of the people I knew personally stopped blogging (tho I‚Äôm also LARGELY guilty of that‚Äî I have been in the 3-to-4 posts a year camp on my primary self-hosted blog) and so my RSS feeds are mostly journalism, news, some weird accumulated tumblr pages, the random people I follow but don‚Äôt know who HAVE been blogging faithfully all this time, and (as the newsletter rebirth exploded and Feedbin added support for them) all the email newsletters I‚Äôm over-subscribed to.</p>
<p>So I‚Äôve been a paid user of Feedbin since something like 2015? I love it, but I also like to do a lot of things in my life and am definitely overcommitted to work and hobbies and family/housekeeping. Things fall by the wayside and as Cohost became a decent way for me to feel ‚Äúaware‚Äù of what was happening online I fell back into one of my periods of less RSS reading.</p>
<p>As Cohost was wrapping up I subscribed to almost every feed I saw people linking to, putting them in a new folder in Feedbin for just them. When I added the feed I put their Cohost username at the end in parentheses, but last night I realized that I wanted to flip it‚Äî I put <code>@username</code> at the front and then put all their carefully considered blog titles in parentheses after that. That small change makes me feel a little bit closer to everyone, as silly as it sounds. (I don‚Äôt consider this blog to have a ‚Äútitle‚Äù per se, btw‚Äî I think topposts dot net is fine for now)</p>
<p>PS I‚Äôm hoping by the end of the weekend I‚Äôll have working h-entry post embeds like Natalie does!! It‚Äôs so cool to see it working at the link at the top of the post and if you haven‚Äôt checked out <a href="https://nex-3.com/">her blog</a> overall you really should!</p>

				<p>there's this weird compulsion where the moment I think I'm making something that might be interesting, I want to polish it to a shine in a way that will make it possible for other people to use it. Despite the fact that it will require an intense and detail-oriented effort to go back and revisit almost every decision, definitely every cut corner, and figure out the "right" way to do it. the error cases to handle. the worries that if I let the software fail, it could hurt someone else.</p>
<p>It sucks! It sucks to feel that weight for absolutely no reason, despite the fact that what you are making is <em>mid</em>, that your knowledge is cobbled together from a bizarre bombardment of information that you've exposed yourself to over your career, both technical and political, that realistically no one cares and if someone does it's because they're already doing the same thing for themselves, or hopefully will someday.</p>
<p>I have to write things into the box and risk them getting posted to the internet in order to test if the software I wrote is working. That's a terrible idea. Automated tests, non-production environments, there are so many ways to make this not be a necessity. And even if not, I <em>can</em> still go delete the file from the repo if I want.</p>
