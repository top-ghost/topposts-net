    </h1>

    <div class="postbody e-content"><p>Natalie's post <a href="https://nex-3.com/blog/a-sociable-web/">A Sociable Web</a> is a fantastic outline of what's happening on the web, in a small way and with references to the larger state of things on established "platforms", and I want to shove it in everyone's faces and make them read it.</p>
<p>I don't consider myself to be fully participating in its "sociable" ideals yet—perhaps obviously, since this is a manual post with a single hyperlink and not a "quote post" or whatever. For whatever it might say about me, I've automated/smoothed out the "performance" part of all of this first and have to be more manual and intentional about the social connection bits.</p>
<p>But! I am really looking forward to moving closer and closer to it and it's nice to have a thing to point at when I'm trying to explain to people what I'm spending time thinking about and working on lately instead of just a mess of ideas, ambitious and achievable, that exists in my head and partially implemented on my own domain.</p>
