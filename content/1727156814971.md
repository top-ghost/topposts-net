there&#x27;s this weird compulsion where the moment I think I&#x27;m making something that might be interesting, I want to polish it to a shine in a way that will make it possible for other people to use it. Despite the fact that it will require an intense and detail-oriented effort to go back and revisit almost every decision, definitely every cut corner, and figure out the &#x22;right&#x22; way to do it. the error cases to handle. the worries that if I let the software fail, it could hurt someone else.

It sucks! It sucks to feel that weight for absolutely no reason, despite the fact that what you are making is _mid_, that your knowledge is cobbled together from a bizarre bombardment of information that you&#x27;ve exposed yourself to over your career, both technical and political, that realistically no one cares and if someone does it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re already doing the same thing for themselves, or hopefully will someday.

I have to write things into the box and risk them getting posted to the internet in order to test if the software I wrote is working. That&#x27;s a terrible idea. Automated tests, non-production environments, there are so many ways to make this not be a necessity. And even if not, I _can_ still go delete the file from the repo if I want.
