upon recent reflection I have realized that I have become reliant on one response to almost every customer service interaction, many interactions at work, and probably some in my personal life: after receiving something from someone, I will say &#x201C;perfect&#x201D;. I don&#x2019;t know where I picked this up but now that I am aware of it I am working very hard to discard it and I&#x2019;m sorry to anyone I may have said it to after being handed a small plastic cup of water on an airplane or my own credit card after purchasing a chicken caesar wrap
