Natalie&#x27;s post [A Sociable Web](https://nex-3.com/blog/a-sociable-web/) is a fantastic outline of what&#x27;s happening on the web, in a small way and with references to the larger state of things on established &#x22;platforms&#x22;, and I want to shove it in everyone&#x27;s faces and make them read it.

I don&#x27;t consider myself to be fully participating in its &#x22;sociable&#x22; ideals yet&#x2014;perhaps obviously, since this is a manual post with a single hyperlink and not a &#x22;quote post&#x22; or whatever. For whatever it might say about me, I&#x27;ve automated/smoothed out the &#x22;performance&#x22; part of all of this first and have to be more manual and intentional about the social connection bits.

But! I am really looking forward to moving closer and closer to it and it&#x27;s nice to have a thing to point at when I&#x27;m trying to explain to people what I&#x27;m spending time thinking about and working on lately instead of just a mess of ideas, ambitious and achievable, that exists in my head and partially implemented on my own domain.
