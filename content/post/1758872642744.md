it&#x27;s actually ridiculous that Blippo+&#x27;s Femtofax has different text-rendering engines for different boards? Like the Read-Only Review does this weird self-correcting for word-wrap, whereas Subspace Spotlight just types it out with wraps pre-calculated. And Micro Meditation is doing a whole thing. Wow!
