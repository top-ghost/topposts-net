I think the most insulting thing about &#x201C;motion smoothing&#x201D; on TVs is that it doesn&#x2019;t even work right on a lot of them! There&#x2019;s a screen tearing effect every 5-6 seconds during scenes where the camera is moving quickly because it can&#x2019;t actually keep up? Like if you&#x2019;re going to make everything look like ass at least take it seriously
