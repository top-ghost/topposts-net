the funniest emoji is &#x1FAA4; because despite [the proposal itself](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19144-mouse-trap-emoji.pdf) showing the modern plank + spring mouse trap design, almost every major implementer, when faced with the design, was like &#x22;yeah no that&#x27;s too gruesome we&#x27;re gonna do the cartoon thing with the box and the stick&#x22;
