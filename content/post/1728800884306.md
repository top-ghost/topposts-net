every time I wonder why I haven&#x27;t played so many cool games this year I remember that I&#x27;ve probably put &#x3E;100 hours each into final fantasy xiv, hearthstone, balatro, and watching balatro videos on youtube. it doesn&#x27;t make me feel better but it does change it from being an x-files-style mystery into just an episode of hoarders
