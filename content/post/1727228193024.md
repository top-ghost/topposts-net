the site upgrades are piling up, I should really backport them to octobug &#x1F914;
among some post editor improvements (better mobile support!) NEW posts should have a new permalink structure while OLD posts retain their old URLs (to hopefully avoid bombarding feeds with &#x22;new&#x22; posts, and to avoid breaking what I&#x27;m sure are hundreds of links to my first ~25 brilliant posts)
