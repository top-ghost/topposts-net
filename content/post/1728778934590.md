inspired by [li&#x27;s roadmap](https://entangled.one/post/1728774235-image-uploads-not-the/) I guess I will share an updated and mostly-off-the-cuff version of mine, based on a quick scan of my original goals and the mountain of todo list items I have accumulated since then:

* I gotta get h-entry consumption working so I can &#x22;reblog&#x22; everyone else who&#x27;s publishing with it (and bully the rest of you into adding support so I can reblog you too)
* The post editor has some rough styling edges that I would like to sand down a bit. I want the headline and body fields to grow with the post. The buttons are ass and I would like them to not be ass
* I need to write some static pages for a blogroll and possibly some other stuff? This isn&#x27;t actually programming or anything, I have no excuse for not doing this sooner
* I want a &#x22;pinned tags&#x22; widget that makes sense on the page in both desktop and mobile
* posts should be editable without using the git repo
* posts should be draftable (I agree with li, localstorage is probably fine for now, though it would be nice to have some alternate strategy
* I need to pull out a bunch of blog-specific things that have been hardcoded and put them into Eleventy Data Files so that my blog is more easily customizable and also probably so I can just take this code, .gitignore the Content and Data files, and force-push back into the octobug repo to have a clean working Eleventy base template.
* I admit I have not been making any progress on also making it possible to use Octobug with an existing static site setup / your own metadata structure. It&#x27;s going to be kinda hard and finicky and weird and I&#x27;m not looking forward to it, sorry!!!!
* I have a couple other very stupid but pretty funny ideas that I&#x27;m going to keep a secret for now &#x1F92B;

it&#x27;s fun that me and a few other people have spent the last ~month tricking each other into using our accumulated programming skills to improve our lives. I mean that genuinely. Ok I really gotta take a shower now bye
