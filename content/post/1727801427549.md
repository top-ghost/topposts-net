> Today, my friend and I launched another new version of our puzzle game named Wizard Sokoban (working title). You can play it on itch.io for free, though it works best on a computer using firefox:


[Go try out Wizard Sokoban](https://anvilfood.itch.io/wizard-sokoban)! I got to level 13 the day after it was released and at that point it&#x2019;s really unfurling into something more complex. I&#x2019;m excited to play more!
