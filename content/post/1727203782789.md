I timed badly the delivery of a new phone (my old one was from 2020 and had had its battery replaced twice&#x2026; I need a bigger battery, apparently) and its accompanying case so I was carrying it around for the last 4 days with no case and it was kind of terrifying.

The new case has arrived and it&#x2019;s a huge relief to know that I am at least somewhat protected from fucking up my phone now
