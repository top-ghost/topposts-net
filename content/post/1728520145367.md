when it comes to the whole mess with WordPress and Matt Mullenweg, one theory I&#x2019;d like to see examined more closely is that an evil magician perhaps used a &#x201C;dumbass curse&#x201D; on him as revenge for a careless act at a coffee shop or child&#x2019;s birthday party. There&#x2019;s even no saying how long ago this happened, or if it&#x2019;s possible that it&#x2019;s happened multiple times and the effects stack
