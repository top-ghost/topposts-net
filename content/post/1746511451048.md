one thing I&#x27;m discovering and grateful for about Octobug when using it across multiple blogs is that when something breaks with it, as long as there&#x27;s _a_ site that builds and updates when I write words into it, I&#x27;m just like &#x22;that&#x27;s okay&#x22;. I know that the YouTube embed code breaks the frame. I know that I haven&#x27;t backported the whole thing where headlines can safely have markdown in them. I still haven&#x27;t integrated WebMentions or whatever. that&#x27;s okay
