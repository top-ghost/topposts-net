It gets the list of tags from the server when you open the post editor

And then as you type it shows the tags you&#x27;ve already used so you can more easily &#x22;do a bit&#x22; that you&#x27;ve done before, and safely put it in the filing cabinet drawer where it belongs.

no I don&#x27;t know why the tag field isn&#x27;t able to use my webfont. I&#x27;ll fix it later
