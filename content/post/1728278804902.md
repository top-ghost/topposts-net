instead of working on octobug this weekend I

* cleaned the garage
* went grocery shopping
* cleaned the kitchen three times
* set up, and learned the routine for, the new basement dehumidifier
* played video games with friends on the internet. TWICE!
* ate at [Fried Egg I&#x27;m In Love](https://www.friedegglove.com/)
* took a nap
* watched Ben-Hur (1925) for my movie club

&#x22;Wow&#x22;, you might say. &#x22;A life well lived.&#x22; and you&#x27;d be right. _except--_

# [now bcj is reblogging things too](https://postnow.site/f97ccbddb0764d4c875e99d59214a56b.html) and I haven&#x27;t implemented h-entry support yet!
