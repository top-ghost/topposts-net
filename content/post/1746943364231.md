things that make it an ARPG:
* isometric
* ties to christianity (gargoyles, white/black as good/evil, the mon-fri work week)
* lose progress when you die

things that make it earthbound:
* protagonist wears baseball cap
* the stakes of your success are never quite clear
* features a SICK STUNT COURSE at the end (confirm this)
