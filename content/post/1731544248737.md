&#x3E; i love how two people can describe something with the same words but one person&#x27;s subtext is that they don&#x27;t like it and the other person&#x27;s subtext is that they do like it

exactly. for example, when Bruno Mars says something makes &#x201C;a dragon want to retire&#x201D; he&#x2019;s saying that it is good, but when I say it, I&#x2019;m trying to highlight how it&#x2019;s accelerating the already troubling burn-out culture within the dragon career path
