I think that the true &#x22;gamer&#x27;s edge&#x22; is the ability to be able to watch a piece of media that depicts gaming culture and clock at any given moment whether it&#x27;s authentic or not. the way a person moves their hands while playing a certain genre of game. the fidelity/depth of sound design relative to the graphical fidelity. the precise level of narrative irony vs the game&#x27;s supposed release date / mainstream appeal.

but then if that is so then there is also a &#x22;knitter&#x27;s edge&#x22;, a &#x22;philatelist&#x27;s edge&#x22;, a &#x22;podcast fan&#x27;s edge&#x22;, and so on for all communities. and the most popular person among each of those worlds must be declared the edgelord
