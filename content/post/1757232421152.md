I don&#x27;t think making the MMX dash an unlock was good for the game, they should have just made it part of the base kit. stage order in megaman in general is a terrible mechanic that excludes a huge number of potential fans and every legacy collection should come with an &#x22;action platformer&#x22; mode that just plays the game in the correct stage order without a menu selection screen at all
