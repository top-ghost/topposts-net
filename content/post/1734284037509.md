thinking about how there&#x2019;s more than one guy out there who meets people and is like &#x201C;yeah I have like a character I do on social media. It&#x2019;s&#x2026; God? yeah like the Christian one. yeah no exactly. I mean the idea of him, I guess. The signifiers. Old guy, beard, omniscient. I don&#x2019;t really get into the religion stuff. No, yeah, it&#x2019;s more like I roll my eyes at Republicans. Yeah, like 15% of all BlueSky users follow me. No, I haven&#x2019;t met Lin-Manuel.&#x201D;
